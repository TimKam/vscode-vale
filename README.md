## Prerequisites

[issue]: https://github.com/testthedocs/vscode-vale/issues/new

## Usage

Vale automatically checks a document when you open or save it.  Use the `Vale: Lint workspace` command to check the entire workspace.

Vale always runs from the workspace directory in either case, so if you put a [Vale configuration][config] in the workspace directory it will automatically pick it up.

Currently this extension only supports **Markdown, reStructuredText, LaTeX and plain text (.txt) documents**; please [open an issue][issue] or a pull request if you need support for **more document formats**, provided that [Vale][] supports them.
